    "7. You will now copy your unique four values into twitterstream.py (download this file on your computer). These values are your \"API Key\", your \"API secret\", your \"Access token\", and your \"Access token secret\". Open twitterstream.py and set the variables corresponding to the api key, api secret, access token, and access secret. You will see code like the below in line 6-9 of the file:\n",

The more datapoints belonging to the same class are clustered together, the higher the likelihood that our machine learning model is simpler and more effective."
